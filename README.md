# Advent of Code 2019 in C++ 

## Day 01

The first exercise was very easy and I went straight to the right solution. But the second one, being easy as well, took 5 
tries to solve it. The main problem I found was my reading, didn't get the idea at first so I coded wrong. Using the rubber
duck technique and using the examples they give, I could reach the solution.

## Day 02

For some reasons I've done it in PHP. I tried a first approach but I understood poorly how an Intcode computer works. So 
after one try I realized what I was doing wrong and I refactored it to a Intcode class that just works. I'll be improving it
this evening or in days with more spare time than today.
