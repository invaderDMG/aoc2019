# Advent of Code 2019 in C++ 

## Day 01

The first exercise was very easy and I went straight to the right solution. But the second one, being easy as well, took 5 
tries to solve it. The main problem I found was my reading, didn't get the idea at first so I coded wrong. Using the rubber
duck technique and using the examples they give, I could reach the solution.
